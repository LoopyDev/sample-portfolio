# About me

I'm Jasmine Gonzalez, a developer of games and creative applications. I build playful systems, tactile interfaces, and story-driven experiences that invite people to slow down and explore.

## What I care about
- Meaningful play that feels human and textured.
- Tools that make experimentation feel effortless.
- Sound, motion, and feedback that guide emotion.

## Practice
I move between Unity prototypes, WebGL experiments, and installation work. I like shipping small, focused projects that help people feel curious and present.

## Collaboration
If you want to build something strange and thoughtful together, reach out at hello@jasminedesigns.dev.
