Pocket Drift is designed to feel like a fidget toy. The player steers with a single thumb, chasing smooth arcs instead of speed. The soundtrack and haptics reward clean curves.

## Design notes
- Built a custom drift curve that prioritizes flow over realism.
- Tuned haptics to match the beat grid for instant feedback.
- Sketched UI around one-handed play and quick sessions.

## Next steps
Expanding the track generator and exploring adaptive music layers so each run feels personal.
