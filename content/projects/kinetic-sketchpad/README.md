Kinetic Sketchpad helps designers explore how text behaves in motion. Each stroke becomes a motion path, and the tool exports both GIFs and editable JSON timelines.

## Highlights
- Built a custom timeline editor with snap-to-beat controls.
- Created a shader pipeline for soft trailing and glow effects.
- Added export presets for social formats and installation loops.

## What I learned
Giving people a playful UI is not enough. The tool became more useful once the export workflow matched professional pipelines.
