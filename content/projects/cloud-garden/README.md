Cloud Garden is an ambient experiment about care. Plants sway and bloom when the microphone picks up a steady rhythm, inviting players to slow down and breathe.

## Focus areas
- Crafted particle systems that feel organic but light on performance.
- Built audio analysis tools to detect gentle input.
- Tested accessibility for players in shared spaces.

## Reflection
The prototype became a quiet reminder that interactivity can be restorative, not just energetic.
