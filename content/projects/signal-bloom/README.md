Signal Bloom explores quiet tension through sound and light. Players align audio frequencies to reveal hidden paths, with every puzzle feeding into a branching story about care and distance.

## What I built
- Designed the signal tuning mechanic and puzzle pacing.
- Authored dynamic audio filters that react to player movement.
- Collaborated on narrative beats and UI flow.

## Takeaway
This project sharpened my approach to blending audio feedback with emotional storytelling. The more intentional the feedback, the more players lean into slower, reflective play.
