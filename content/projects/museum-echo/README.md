Museum Echo uses spatial audio to let visitors remix archival audio. As people move, the room shifts from whispers to full orchestration, revealing stories that feel personal.

## Installation system
- Designed the spatial mapping between floor zones and audio stems.
- Calibrated sensor input for multiple bodies in motion.
- Built a backstage dashboard for curators to adjust intensity.
